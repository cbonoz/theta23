Let's walk through the Adoptify website.

First, make sure your wallet is connected with MetaMask.

Then, click on “connect wallet”.

When a visitor to an adoption shelter finds a pet they’d like to help but are unable to adopt, our application provides an option to instead sponsor the animal and find it a home. 

You’ll be given the option to choose your view. The donor view is for animal shelters and the creator view is for the ThetaTV streamers. 

Let’s walk through the donor view first.

You’ll be directed your account page, where you can check your theta wallet balance as well as update your account profile.

To register an animal, click on register pet.

[Go to Register Pet]

The donor starts by uploading details of the animal along with a wallet address for the shelter, which will later verify when someone adopts the pet.

A donor can then fund a content creator or influencer from the Theta TV platform to promote the pet. Once the donor has made a selection and has funds available for transfer, they can proceed to mint the NFT. This action triggers a smart contract on the Theta blockchain, ensuring transparency and security throughout the process.

Congratulations! You've just minted a unique NFT that represents your support for your favorite animal. The streamer you selected automatically receives the funds and can start working to get it adopted as quickly as possible.

You can also check out your transaction data by clicking on the transactions tab.

[Go to transactions]

You can look at your transaction history as well as your registered pets.

Next, let’s walkthrough the creator view for the streamers.

You can switch the view to streamers portal by clicking on account and clicking on the button switch view.  Click on creator.

For Theta TV streamers, Adoptify offers an immediate source of revenue as well as a good cause. 

You can click on adopted pets to view all the pets you’ve adopted.

You can click on the transaction page to view the transactions for your adopted pets. By exploring a streamer’s blockchain transaction, streamers can gain insight on how to efficiently earn revenue and help shelter pets. They can also view and share the details of all the animals they have helped here.

But Adoptify goes beyond the creation and sale of NFTs. We foster a vibrant community of individuals passionate about animal welfare. Through the platform, you can connect with like-minded members, participate in events and campaigns, and contribute directly to shelter initiatives.


Narrator: "In conclusion, Adoptify bridges the gap between art, technology, and animal welfare. By minting NFTs from known creators and supporting them while allocating significant funds to shelters, we create a sustainable ecosystem that drives adoption rates and makes a real difference in the lives of shelter animals."
